Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Branches are commits with labels.  When you clone a repository, a remote is automatically created for you that includes all commits, including branches, from the repo.  You can clone locally  or from a remote repo.  A fork is a function of github.  You are cloning on the github servers. More efficient way instead of cloning locally, creating repo on github, and then pushing.  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  You can work offline.  If the remote master has been udpated, you can git fetch the differences. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  Github brings it all together.  Some remote method of storing repos.
